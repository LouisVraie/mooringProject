## Presentation

This is a multidisciplinary project in collaboration between the Computer Science Master and MSc MARRES of Côte d'Azur University

The goal of this project was to create some tools to help MSc MARRES students for the *Analysis of aerial images to protect marine ecosystems* on the Lérins Islands.


## Tools
- `AnchorHeatmap/` : Creation of a anchor heatmap, made by Laurent Peraldi ;
- `DetectionAndClassification` : Detection and classification of boats, made by Alireza Foroutan Torkaman ;
- `MooredBoatsHeatmap/` : Creation of a heatmap to represent the moored boats, made by Louis Vraie ;
- `PosidoniaEvolution/` : Analysis of posidonia evolution through the years, made by Yasmine Boudiaf ;
